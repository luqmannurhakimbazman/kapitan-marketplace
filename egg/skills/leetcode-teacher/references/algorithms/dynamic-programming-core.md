## 1. DP Framework Principles

### The Three-Step DP Process

Every DP problem is solved by answering three questions in order:

1. **Clarify the state** -- what variables change between subproblems? (index, remaining capacity, last choice, etc.)
2. **Clarify the choices** -- at each state, what decisions can you make?
3. **Define `dp` meaning** -- `dp[state]` = the answer to the subproblem defined by that state

Then find the base case and write the state transition equation.

*Socratic prompt: "What changes between subproblems? That's your state. What decisions do you make at each state? That's your choice list."*

### Overlapping Subproblems & Memoization

The hallmark of DP: the brute-force recursion recomputes the same subproblems exponentially many times.

**Fibonacci example:** Naive recursion computes `fib(18)` multiple times within `fib(20)`. The recursion tree has O(2^n) nodes.

**Fix:** Add a memo (hash map or array) to cache results. Each subproblem is solved exactly once.

```python
# Top-down with memoization
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
```

**Time complexity drops from O(2^n) to O(n)** -- each of the n subproblems is solved once in O(1).

### Top-Down vs Bottom-Up

| Approach | Direction | Implementation | When to Use |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Top-down** (memoized recursion) | Start from target, recurse to base | `@lru_cache` or memo dict | Natural when recursion structure is clear |
| **Bottom-up** (tabulation) | Start from base cases, build up | Fill `dp` array iteratively | When you need space optimization or iterative control |

```python
# Bottom-up tabulation for Coin Change (LC 322)
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins needed for amount 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i - coin >= 0 and dp[i - coin] != float('inf'):
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

**Mathematical induction analogy:** Top-down DP IS mathematical induction. You assume smaller subproblems are correct (inductive hypothesis) and show how to combine them (inductive step). The base case is the base case.

*Socratic prompt: "Can you write the top-down version first? Once that works, can you convert it to bottom-up by reversing the direction?"*

### Space Optimization (Rolling Array)

When the state transition only depends on the previous row/column, you don't need the full DP table.

**Pattern:** If `dp[i]` only depends on `dp[i-1]` (and possibly `dp[i-2]`), replace the array with two variables:

```python
# Fibonacci: O(1) space
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    prev2, prev1 = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        curr = prev1 + prev2
        prev2, prev1 = prev1, curr
    return prev1
```

**For 2D DP:** If `dp[i][j]` only depends on `dp[i-1][...]`, use a single 1D array and update it carefully (usually right-to-left for 0-1 knapsack, left-to-right for complete knapsack).

> **Tip:** Always check which previous states your transition actually needs before allocating the full table.

*Socratic prompt: "Look at your state transition. Which previous states does dp[i] actually need? Can you keep only those?"*

### Common DP Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Wrong base case | Off-by-one errors, wrong answer for small inputs | Trace through the smallest cases by hand |
| Wrong state definition | DP doesn't capture enough info to make transitions | Add dimensions (e.g., add a "holding stock" boolean) |
| Missing states | Some subproblems not covered | Ensure every reachable state has a transition |
| Integer overflow in memo | `dp[i] + dp[j]` overflows | Use `float('inf')` or check before adding |
| Forgetting to memoize | Top-down runs in exponential time | Always add `@lru_cache` or memo check |

## 2. Subsequence & String DP

### Two Fundamental Templates

**Template 1: `dp[i]` (single sequence)** -- answer involves elements ending at or up to index `i`.

**Template 2: `dp[i][j]` (two sequences or two pointers)** -- compares prefixes `s[:i]` and `t[:j]`, or a single sequence with two endpoints.

| Signal | Template | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| One array, "longest subsequence ending at i" | `dp[i]` | LIS (300) |
| Two strings, "similarity/distance/matching" | `dp[i][j]` | LCS (1143), Edit Distance (72) |
| One string, palindrome-related | `dp[i][j]` | Longest Palindromic Subsequence (516) |
| One string, "can it be segmented" | `dp[i]` (boolean) | Word Break (139) |

### Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) -- LC 300

**State:** `dp[i]` = length of LIS ending at `nums[i]`.

**Transition:** For each `j < i` where `nums[j] < nums[i]`: `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.

```python
def length_of_lis(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [1] * n
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)  # O(n^2)
```

**O(n log n) optimization -- Patience Sorting:**

```python
import bisect

def length_of_lis_fast(nums):
    tails = []
    for num in nums:
        pos = bisect.bisect_left(tails, num)
        if pos == len(tails):
            tails.append(num)
        else:
            tails[pos] = num
    return len(tails)
```

*Socratic prompt: "Why does replacing tails[pos] with a smaller value not break the LIS? What invariant does the tails array maintain?"*

**Related:** Russian Doll Envelopes (354) -- sort by width ascending, height descending for same width, then find LIS on heights.

### Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) -- LC 1143

**State:** `dp[i][j]` = length of LCS of `s1[:i]` and `s2[:j]`.

```python
def longest_common_subsequence(s1, s2):
    m, n = len(s1), len(s2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    return dp[m][n]
```

*Socratic prompt: "When s1[i-1] != s2[j-1], why do we take the max of skipping from either string?"*

### Edit Distance -- LC 72

**State:** `dp[i][j]` = minimum operations to convert `s[:i]` to `t[:j]`.

```python
def min_distance(word1, word2):
    m, n = len(word1), len(word2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    for i in range(m + 1):
        dp[i][0] = i
    for j in range(n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = j
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = 1 + min(
                    dp[i - 1][j],      # Delete
                    dp[i][j - 1],      # Insert
                    dp[i - 1][j - 1]   # Replace
                )
    return dp[m][n]
```

### Maximum Subarray -- LC 53

**State:** `dp[i]` = max sum of subarray ending at index `i`.

```python
def max_subarray(nums):
    max_sum = curr_sum = nums[0]
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        curr_sum = max(nums[i], curr_sum + nums[i])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum)
    return max_sum
```

### Word Break -- LC 139

**State:** `dp[i]` = True if `s[:i]` can be segmented into dictionary words.

```python
def word_break(s, word_dict):
    word_set = set(word_dict)
    n = len(s)
    dp = [False] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = True
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            if dp[j] and s[j:i] in word_set:
                dp[i] = True
                break
    return dp[n]
```

### Regular Expression Matching -- LC 10

**State:** `dp[i][j]` = True if `s[:i]` matches pattern `p[:j]`.

```python
def is_match(s, p):
    m, n = len(s), len(p)
    dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True
    for j in range(2, n + 1):
        if p[j - 1] == '*':
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 2]
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if p[j - 1] == '*':
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 2]
                if p[j - 2] == '.' or p[j - 2] == s[i - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] or dp[i - 1][j]
            elif p[j - 1] == '.' or p[j - 1] == s[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
    return dp[m][n]
```

### Subsequence DP: General Patterns

**Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LC 516):** `dp[i][j]` = LPS of `s[i..j]`. If `s[i] == s[j]`, extend by 2. Otherwise, `max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])`. Note: fill diagonally or bottom-up since `dp[i]` depends on `dp[i+1]`.

**Minimum Insertions for Palindrome (LC 1312):** `len(s) - LPS(s)` = minimum insertions needed.

**Two Subsequence Templates Summary:**

| Template | When | Direction | Base |
|----------|------|-----------|------|
| `dp[i]` | Single sequence, ending at i | Left to right | `dp[i] = 1` or `dp[0] = base` |
| `dp[i][j]` | Two sequences or range `[i..j]` | Row by row or diagonal | `dp[i][i] = base` or `dp[0][j]`/`dp[i][0]` |

## 3. Shortest Path DP: Floyd-Warshall

### All-Pairs Shortest Path

**State:** `dp[i][j]` = shortest path weight from node `i` to node `j`.

**Transition (the k-loop):** For each intermediate node `k`, check if going through `k` improves the path: `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j])`.

```python
def floyd_warshall(n, edges):
    INF = float('inf')
    dp = [[INF] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = 0
    for u, v, w in edges:
        dp[u][v] = w

    # The triple loop: k MUST be the outermost loop
    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if dp[i][k] != INF and dp[k][j] != INF:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j])

    return dp
```

**Why k must be outermost:** The DP builds up by considering paths that use only nodes `{0, 1, ..., k}` as intermediates.

**Complexity:** O(n^3) time, O(n^2) space. Suitable for `n <= 400` approximately.

**Comparison with other shortest path algorithms:**

| Algorithm | Problem Type | Negative Weights? | Complexity |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| BFS | Single-source, unweighted | N/A | O(V + E) |
| Dijkstra | Single-source, non-negative | No | O((V+E) log V) |
| Bellman-Ford | Single-source, any | Yes | O(VE) |
| Floyd-Warshall | All-pairs | Yes (no neg cycles) | O(V^3) |

*Socratic prompt: "When would you use Floyd-Warshall instead of running Dijkstra from every node? What if the graph has negative edges?"*

**Example problem:** Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance (LC 1334).
