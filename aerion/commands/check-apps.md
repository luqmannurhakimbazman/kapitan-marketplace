# Check Applications

Scan Gmail for job application status updates and sync them to the Job Tracker Google Sheet.

## Prerequisites

If Gmail or Google Sheets MCP tools are not available, stop immediately and tell the user: "MCP servers are not connected. Please add Gmail and Google Sheets connectors."

**Tool discovery:** Tool name prefixes vary by environment. On local Claude Code they use `mcp__plugin_aerion_gmail__` and `mcp__plugin_aerion_google-sheets__`. On Cowork they use different prefixes. Look up available tools by **function name** (e.g., `gmail_search_messages`, `list_spreadsheets`), not by prefix.

## Steps

### 1. Determine Time Range

Use `$ARGUMENTS` as the number of days to look back. Default to 7 if not provided.

### 2. Search Gmail

Use the Gmail search tool (`gmail_search_messages` or `Search Gmail Emails`) with this query:

```
to:lluqmannurhakim@gmail.com (subject:application OR subject:interview OR subject:offer OR subject:assessment OR subject:"online assessment" OR subject:"phone screen" OR subject:"coding challenge" OR subject:"not moving forward" OR subject:congratulations OR subject:"candidate reference" OR subject:"your submission" OR subject:superday OR subject:"virtual onsite" OR subject:"final round" OR subject:"regret to inform" OR subject:"schedule a call" OR subject:"pleased to offer" OR subject:"offer letter" OR from:greenhouse.io OR from:greenhouse-mail.io OR from:lever.co OR from:ashbyhq.com OR from:myworkdayjobs.com OR from:myworkday.com OR from:icims.com OR from:smartrecruiters.com OR from:jobvite.com OR from:successfactors.com OR from:successfactors.eu OR from:taleo.net OR from:hire.jazz.co OR from:breezy.hr OR from:applytojob.com OR from:hackerrankforwork.com OR from:codesignal.com OR from:codility.com OR from:hirevue.com OR from:hackerearth.com OR from:karat.com OR from:shl.com OR from:testgorilla.com OR from:brassring.com OR from:avature.net OR from:phenom.com) newer_than:${days}d
```

### 3. Read Matched Emails

For each search result, use the Gmail read tool (`gmail_read_message` or `Read Gmail Email`) to retrieve the full email content. Read emails in parallel where possible.

**Thread handling:** If a search result is part of a thread with multiple messages, use `gmail_read_thread` to read the full thread. When a thread contains multiple stage signals (e.g., an application confirmation followed by an interview invite), use the **most recent message** as the authoritative signal for stage classification. Earlier messages in the thread should only be used for entity extraction (Company, Role) if the latest message lacks them.

### 4. Read Current Sheet

1. Use `list_spreadsheets` to find "Job Tracker" in the hojicha folder.
2. Use `list_sheets` with the spreadsheet ID to discover the sheet tab name (it's `job-tracker`).
3. Use `get_sheet_data` with the spreadsheet ID and sheet name `job-tracker` to read all current rows.

### 5. Classify and Match

Invoke the `job-tracker` skill knowledge to:
- Classify each email into a Stage
- Extract Company, Role, Date, and Note
- Match against existing sheet rows by Company + Role
- Apply stage progression rules (forward-only, except Rejected/Ghosted)

### 5a. Scan for Ghosted Applications

After classifying emails, scan all existing sheet rows for potential ghosted applications:
- For each row where Stage is **not** a terminal state (Rejected, Ghosted, Offered):
  - If `Last Contact Date` is more than 30 days before today's date, flag it as a Ghosted candidate
- Do **not** flag rows that received a new email in this scan (they have recent activity)
- Collect flagged rows into a separate "Possibly Ghosted" list for user review

### 6. Present Summary

Show the user:
- **Updates** — existing rows with stage changes (old → new)
- **New applications** — rows to add (Stage = Applied)
- **Possibly Ghosted** — rows with no email activity for >30 days (show Company, Role, current Stage, Last Contact Date, and days since last contact). Ask the user to confirm each one before marking as Ghosted.
- **Ambiguous** — emails that need user input

### 7. Confirm and Write

Ask the user to confirm. On confirmation:

#### 7a. Pre-write snapshot
Re-read the full sheet with `get_sheet_data` immediately before writing. This is your fresh baseline — do not rely on the Step 4 read. Calculate all target cell ranges from this snapshot.

#### 7b. Write changes
- Use `update_cells` for existing row updates (specify sheet name `job-tracker`)
- Use `update_cells` for new applications — target the first empty row after the last occupied row in the snapshot (e.g., if last data is row 32, write to `A33:E33`)
- NEVER use `add_rows` to append data (it inserts at the top by default, shifting all existing rows down)
- Do NOT write anything the user rejected or skipped

#### 7c. Verify (new rows only)
After appending new rows, re-read the sheet and confirm:
- All pre-existing rows from the snapshot are unchanged (same values, same positions)
- New rows appear at expected positions with correct values

If any mismatch: stop, show expected vs actual, propose specific `update_cells` recovery calls from the snapshot, and wait for user confirmation before executing.
