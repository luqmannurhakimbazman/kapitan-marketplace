# Cover Letter Guide

## When to Write a Cover Letter

| Candidate Profile | Cover Letter Value |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| Entry-level / student | High — differentiates you from identical CVs |
| Career changer | High — explains the "why" behind your pivot |
| Experienced (5+ years) | Low — your CV speaks for itself; write one only if explicitly requested |
| Referral / networking intro | Medium — reinforces the warm introduction |

If the application portal marks the cover letter as optional and you're experienced, skip it. If you're a student or career changer, always write one.

## Format & Constraints

| Parameter | Guideline |
|-----------|-----------|
| Length | 1 page max — aim for 70-90% of an A4/letter page |
| Word count | ~600 words standard; ~300 words for short-form personal statements (e.g., Goldman Sachs) |
| Font / style | Match your resume font and header for visual consistency |
| File format | PDF — same as the resume |
| File name | `cover-letter.pdf` or `<firstname>-<lastname>-cover-letter.pdf` |

## Four-Paragraph Structure

Every cover letter follows this structure. Do not deviate.

### Paragraph 1: Hook & Introduction

State who you are, the exact role you're applying for, and a personal connection to the firm. The hook should answer: *Why are you writing to this specific firm?*

**Good:** "Having spoken with [Name] at your [Event] in [Month], I was struck by [specific insight] — it confirmed my interest in the [Role] at [Firm]."

**Bad:** "I am writing to apply for the [Role] position I saw on your website." *(Generic — no personal connection.)*

### Paragraph 2: Selling Your Experience

Map your top 2-3 experiences directly to the JD requirements. Use the same keywords the JD uses. This is the XYZ formula applied to prose — lead with the accomplishment, quantify the impact, explain the method.

**Good:** "At [Company], I built a real-time data pipeline processing 2M+ events/day using Kafka and Flink — directly relevant to the streaming infrastructure challenge outlined in your JD."

**Bad:** "I have experience with many programming languages and technologies." *(Vague — no mapping to JD.)*

### Paragraph 3: Why This Firm

Demonstrate genuine knowledge of the firm. Contrast it with peers. Name-drop employees you've met, cite recent deals, initiatives, or technical blog posts. This paragraph is the hardest to write well and the easiest to spot when faked.

**Good:** "Your recent [Deal/Initiative/Paper] demonstrated [specific insight]. Having discussed this with [Name, Title] at [Event], I see a clear alignment with my work on [relevant project]."

**Bad:** "[Firm] is a leading global company with $X billion in revenue and offices in 30 countries." *(Copy-pasted from the About page — every applicant can do this.)*

### Paragraph 4: Professional Close

Restate your interest, mention availability, and thank the reader. Keep it to 2-3 sentences.

**Good:** "I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in [domain] can contribute to [team/initiative]. I am available for interviews at your convenience. Thank you for your time and consideration."

## Do's and Don'ts

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Keep it succinct — every sentence must pass the "So what?" test | Be arrogant or presumptuous about getting the role |
| Mention firm events you attended and name-drop contacts | Copy-paste statistics from the company's About page |
| Include transferable skills mapped to JD requirements | Use generic phrases that could apply to any company |
| Share your story — what drives you toward this role | Make spelling or grammar errors (proofread twice) |
| Speak the firm's language — mirror terminology from the JD and website | Keyword-stuff without substance |
| Apply the "So what?" test to every sentence | Repeat your resume bullet-for-bullet — add context the resume can't convey |

## Tailoring Strategy

Template reuse is fine — the four-paragraph structure stays constant. Customize these elements per application:

1. **Paragraph 1**: Look up a recent firm event, deal, or blog post. Reference a specific person you've met or whose work you've followed.
2. **Paragraph 2**: Reorder and reframe your experiences to match the specific JD. Use the JD's exact terminology.
3. **Paragraph 3**: Research at least one concrete differentiator — why this firm over its competitors. This is the paragraph most candidates get wrong by being generic.
4. **File name**: Include the company name in the file name.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|---------|-------------|
| Empty flattery ("world-class", "industry-leading") | Signals you haven't done real research |
| Generic stats from the company website | Every applicant can Google the same numbers |
| Not proofreading | Immediate rejection — signals low attention to detail |
| Keyword stuffing without substance | Reads as desperate; no recruiter is fooled |
| Rehashing the resume line by line | Wastes the opportunity to add context and personality |
| Writing more than one page | Signals poor communication skills — brevity is a feature |
